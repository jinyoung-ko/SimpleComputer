## Overview
This is created using Qt. This calculator first converts the [infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) equation into [postfix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation#Postfix_evaluation_algorithm). After the conversion, the problem is then solved. There is a help dialog that explains the postfix symbols. For instance, the symbol ~ means negate. When the 2nd button is clicked a whole new set of functions appear.
